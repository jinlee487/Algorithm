HeightBalancedBinaryTree

For this problem, we have to find out if the binary tree is balanced from left and right. If the left and right height difference is equal or less than 1, it is balanced. Every node has to be balanced in order for the entire tree to be balanced. 

We can create a class treeinfo to store height and boolean to solve for this. 

O(n) time | O(h) space where h is the height of the tree.
