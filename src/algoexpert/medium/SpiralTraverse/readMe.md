SpiralTraverse

For this problem, it is easy to think of it as getting the pheripherals of the arrays in a clockwise order. 

We can set up the start and end index for the columns and rows and loop until we complete traversing all the values. 

The time complexity is O(n) while space complexity is O(n)
