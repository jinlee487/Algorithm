LevenshteinDistance

for this problem, we use a dp to solve for the minimum number of edits. 

For the first method, we can create a 2d array and solve for the value. 

O(nm) time | O(nm) space

For the second method, we can use a temporary array to reduce the space complexity. 

O(nm) time | O(min(n,m)) space

We rotate the two temp arrays until we reach the end, we retrieve the value from the last traversed array of the two.
