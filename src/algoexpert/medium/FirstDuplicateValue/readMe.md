FirstDuplicateValue
For this problem, we can use the brute force technique to solve the problem. This would give us  O(n^2) time | O(1) space. 

The second option would be to use a hash set to keep track of the values in constant time. This would give us O(n) time | O(n) space.

The third method is by using the detail of the problem that all of the values of the array is 1 ~ n (length of the array). So we can use the given array to keep track of values. This would give us O(n) time | O(1) space
