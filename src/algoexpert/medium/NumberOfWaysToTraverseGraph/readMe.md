NumberOfWaysToTraverseGraph

There are three ways to solve this problem.

The first method is a recursion process of finding the number of ways for the previous box. 

O(2^n+m)) time | O(n+m) space 

The second method is iterating and adding number of ways but not the already traversed boxes.

O(n*m)) time | O(n*m) space 

The third method is using permutation. 

{rrrdd} 

in any order.

O(n+m) time | O(1) space
