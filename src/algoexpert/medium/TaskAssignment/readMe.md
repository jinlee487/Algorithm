TaskAssignment

This problem is a greedy problem.

We have to return an arraylist containing array of minimum total work time. 
The first indices can hold the first order, then the second indices can hold the values from the back. 

Using the pop() methods constant time operation, we can do this easily. 

O(nlog(n)) time | O(n) space
