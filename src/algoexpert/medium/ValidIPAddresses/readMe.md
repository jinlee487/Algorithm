Valid I P Addresses

For this problem, we can simply loop 3 times to find the ip addresses and add it to our ansewr list. 
This is acceptable because we are given that the lenth of the string is only going to be max of 12 and the ip address containts only 4 integers. 4 * 8 = 32. 
O(n^32) = O(1) time | O(1) space
