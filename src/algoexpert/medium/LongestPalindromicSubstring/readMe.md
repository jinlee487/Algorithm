Longest Palindromic Substring

For this problem, there is two methods.

The first method is to simply loop all the posible combinations and checking whether or not it is a palindrome

O(n^3) time | O(n) space

The second method is to loop the string but check the string from the middle. 

O(n^2) time | O(n) space
