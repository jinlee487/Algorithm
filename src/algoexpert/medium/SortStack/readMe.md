Sort Stack

For this problem, we recursively go through the stack and replace the value with the smaller value. 

This would give us a time complexity of maximum O(n^2) and space complexity of O(n)

because if there is the smallest value at the end of the stack, it must be traversed all the way to the beginning and back.
