InvertBinaryTree

For this problem, we can go and swap the left and right tree for each nodes starting from left to right. Once we finish, all the nodes will be reversed. Should draw it out if it helps. 

Iterative method uses dequeue.
Recursive method is simpler. 
Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n)
