Generate Div Tags

For this problem,

You can generate the strings and add it to the returning array.

The first solution is brute force all the possible solutions and check if it is a correct div

Since this is a brute force, the complexity would be not optimal.

The optimal solution would be to create only the correct strings with divs.

O((2n)! / ((n!((n+1)!)))) time | O((2n)! / ((n!((n+1)!)))) space
