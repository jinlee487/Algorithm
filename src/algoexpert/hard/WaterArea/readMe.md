In the first method, we can make an array for recording the biggest height and add the remainder of the subtraction of the max height with the current height to the total water variable.

This would give us O(n) time | O(n) space

In the second method, we can do away with the array and simply use a variable to assign the max height. 

This would give us O(n) time | O(1) space
