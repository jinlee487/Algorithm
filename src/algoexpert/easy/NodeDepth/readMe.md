To solve this problem, 

We can use recursive or iterative methods. 

for the recursive method in java, 

we can make a new method for recursive computation. 

for the recursive method in javaScript and python, 

we can make use of the easy default parameter functionality
and get away with not creatinga separate function or definition

for the iterative method in java, 
we can create a stack to add and pop the Level classes we made to keep track of the nodes and the depth. 

for the iterative method in javascript and python,
we can use a regular list but use push, pop, and append to make the list function like a stack in java.
we can also get away with not creating a separate class because we can make use of the 
easy object or dictionary creation in javascript and python
