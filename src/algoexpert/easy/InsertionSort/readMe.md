InsertionSort

For this problem,

It is similar to bubble sort.
We check if the number is smaller than the previous number and we continue comparing that number to the previous value until we find its right place. 
After we insert the value in the correct index, we then move on to the next value.

Space complexity is O(1) 
but time complexity for worst scenario is O(N^2)
