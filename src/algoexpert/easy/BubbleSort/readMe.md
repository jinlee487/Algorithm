Bubble sort is a sorting method where we traverse the array multiple times and sorting two values at a time and repeating the loop until all the values in the array are sorted. 

The advantage to this method is that the space complexity is O(1) since we are not creating any new array to help with the sorting. 
However the time complexity at the worst case scenario is O(n^2) since we are doing a loop inside a loop.
