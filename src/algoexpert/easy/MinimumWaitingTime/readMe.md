For this problem, we have to sort the array from smallest to largest. Then we replace the array values with the sum of numbers infront of them. 
We sum the total then that is the answer.

The time complexity is O(nLog(n)) because sorting the array takes minimum of nlog(n) time
The space complexity is O(1) not extra space. So constant space.
