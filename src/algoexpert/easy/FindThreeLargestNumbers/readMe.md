for this problem, there is two solutions. 

The easier solution is simply sorting the array then returning the 3 largest of the sorted array. 

However this would give time complexity of O(nLog(n))

The slightly more difficult solution would be to simply traverse the array and find the three biggest so we only observe the values once. 

This would give us a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1)
