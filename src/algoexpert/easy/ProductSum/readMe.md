For this problem, we want to loop the array once and if we find any arrays, we want to recursively call the function to loop that array. 

This will give us a time complexity of O(n) since we are only traversing the array once. 

and 

space complexity of O(d) 

d is the greatest depth of the arrays. Since the that is the most space we use at once time.
